I suspect that this is used with this name to reuse one of the available names in the certificate for https.",

      "message": "It is exactly as Jorge says - because HTTPS is used, the certificate used by the simulator must appear in the certificate file; originally chose this for expediency and have never taken the time to change it.  If Jorge can provide an updated cert file with an additional certificate, we can change it, though I don\u0027t know if we can change it to \"message-router\" since that\u0027s already in use (but maybe?) - thus no way to avoid the need to overlay the defaultConfig.json in all of the other components.",
